1. Line 12 will print out the final value of ```i``` at the end of the for loop, which is *3*. There isn't an error because we used ```var```, which is not block-scope. Also, the reason why ```i = 3``` is because the ```prices.length = 3```. By the 4th iteration of the for-loop (```i = 3```), ```i``` is no longer < ```prices.length```. So we will exit the for-loop with the final value of ```i``` being 3.
   
2. Line 13 will print out the final value of ```discountedPrice``` after the for-loop is done executing, which is *150*. There isn't any error because we also used ```var``` to declare ```discountedPrice```. Hence, we can use it even outside of the for-loop. The reason why ```discountedPrice = 150``` is because the last value of ```i``` that can still be used inside the for-loop is 2. We know that ```discountedPrice = prices[i] * (1 - discount)```. If we plug in all appropriate values, we will have ```discountedPrice = prices[2] * (1 - discount)```, which equals to ```300 * (1 - 0.5) = 150```.
   
3. Line 14 will print out the final value of ```finalPrice``` after the for-loop is done executing, which is *150*. There isn't any error because we also used ```var``` to declare ```finalPrice```. The reason why ```finalPrice = 150``` is because the final value of ```discountedPrice``` is 150. We know that ```finalPrice = Math.round(discountedPrice * 100)/100;```. If we plug in all appropriate values, we will have ```finalPrice = Math.round(150 * 100)/100 = 15000/100 = 150```.

4. ```discountPrices([100, 200, 300], .5)``` will return ```[50, 100, 150]``` because we are looping through the original array of prices, reducing the value of each item by half then add these new discounted prices into the new array call ```discounted```. This is what the function returns. Also, since we declared ```discounted``` with the ```var``` keyword, we can still access its final value even outside of the for-loop.

5. Line 12 gives me an error: ```ReferenceError: i is not defined```. This makes sense because we using the keyword ```let``` to declare ```i```. So ```i``` will only have the block-scope within the for-loop. Since line 12 is outside of the for-loop, using ```i``` will cause an error.

6. Line 13 will also give me an error: ```ReferenceError: discountedPrice is not defined```. The reason is similar to that in question 5: we are using the ```let``` keyword to declare ```discountedPrice``` inside the for-loop. Hence, using that variable in line 13, which is outside of the for-loop, will cause an error.

7. Line 14 will print out *150*, which is the final value of ```finalPrice```. The reason why this line doesn't throw an error despite using ```let``` is that we are declaring ```finalPrice``` outside of the for-loop and inside the general function. Thus, we can still access it before, inside and after the for-loop (which is inside the general function).

8. This function will return ```[50, 100, 150]``` because we are looping through the original array of prices, reducing the value of each item by half then add these new discounted prices into the new array call ```discounted```. This is what the function returns. Also, despite declaring ```discounted``` with the ```let``` keyword, we are declaring it outside of the for-loop and inside the general function. Thus, we can still access it before, inside and after the for-loop (which is inside the general function).

9. ```ReferenceError: i is not defined``` is thrown because ```i``` is declared using ```let``` inside the for-loop block. Thus, it's not visible outside of the for-loop block, which is line 11.

10. Line 12 will print out the length of the array ```prices```, which is 3 for the specific case of ```[100, 200, 300]```. The reason why this doesn't throw any errors despite declaring the ```length``` variable with a ```const``` keyword is that we are not trying to reassign a new value to ```length```. We just want to access and return its value.

11. This function will return ```[50, 100, 150]```. Despite declaring the ```discounted``` array with a ```const``` keyword, it does not define a constant array. It define a constant reference to the array. Thanks to this, we can still modify the elements of a constant array like pushing new elements to the array. Thus, we can still get a correct ```discounted``` array despite using ```const``` keyword. (Reference: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_const.asp)

## DATA TYPES
12. A. ```student.name```
    
    B. ```student['Grad Year']```

    C. ```student.greeting()```

    D. ```student['Favorite Teacher'].name```
    
    E. ```student.courseLoad[0]``` (Note: I am assuming "first index" is index 0 of the array. If I misunderstood and the question is asking for the item at index 1, the answer will be ```student.courseLoad[1]```)

## Basic Operators & Type Conversion 
13. Arithmetic\
    A. ```'32'```. This output is a string because '3' is a string; so the plus sign here acts to concatenate strings together. Thus, Javascript converts the number 2 into its string representation '2' and concatenate with '3'. Hence, the output is the string '32'.

    B. ```1```. This output is a number. Despite '3' is a string, the negative sign only has a mathematical meaning (which is subtracting). Thus, Javascript converts the string '3' into its number representation and subtract 2 from it. Hence, the output is the number 1.

    C. ```3```. This output is a number because ```null``` is equivalent to number 0 in Javascript. Thus, we can treat this expression as 3 + 0 = 3. Hence, the output is the number 3.

    D. ```0```. This putput is a number because ```false``` and ```null``` is equivalent to number 0 in Javascript. Thus, we can treat this expression as 0 + 0 = 0. Hence, the output is the number 0.

    E. ```3undefined```. This output is a string. This is similar to expression A. Since '3' is a string, the plus sign here acts to concatenate strings together. Thus, Javascript converts ```undefined``` into its string representation ```'undefined'``` and concatenate with '3'. Hence, the output is the string ```'3undefined'```.

    F. ```NaN```. This output is a number. Despite '3' is a string, the negative sign only has a mathematical meaning (which is subtracting). Thus, Javascript converts the string '3' into its number representation and subtract ```NaN``` (which s the equivalent value of ```undefined```) from it. Since ```3 - NaN = NaN```, the output is the number ```NaN```.
